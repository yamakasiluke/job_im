                This is a simple Todo application showing you the integration of <a href="http://prooph.github.io/proophessor/">prooph components</a> into a Symfony web application.

            <h3>About The Domain</h3>
            <p>
                The domain of our Todo example application is very small. Two aggregates are responsible for handing the business logic:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first one is the User aggregate. Its task is to post new Todos of the user on a todo list.</li>
                <li>The second one is the Todo aggregate which manages the state of a Todo.</li>
                <li>A Todo is just a line of text describing an open task for the user who owns the Todo.</li>
                <li>A Todo can be marked as done</li>
                <li>A Todo can be reopened</li>
                <li>A Todo can have a Deadline</li>
                <li>A User can add Reminders to get notified about the open Todo.</li>
                <li>A User gets notified via email.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
